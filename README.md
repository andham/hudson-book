To build this book, you will need:

  - aciidoc
  - ImageMagick - the Maven build shells out to "convert"
  - bash
  
Note that this build has been tested on Ubuntu 11.04 and OSX 10.6.

The dependency on ImageMagick may cause problems for people using Microsoft
Windows. If you are using Microsoft Windows, we recommend that you upgrade to a
real operation system.

Run:

   ./build.sh
