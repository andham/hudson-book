      <title>Relying on Unix Users and Groups</title>

      <!--This section needs to explore the details of relying on the Unix user/group database from the previous section.   Talk about the
limitations of this approach.   How does it work?   Are there any limitations?   what are the pros and cons?   Try to get specific 
here by showing people what specific commands can be used to user new users and manage groups.    Feel free to choose a Linux flavor
for this and provide some handwaving examples for other platforms.
