    <para>Depending on the plugins installed and activated on your Hudson
      system different sections will be available in the system configuration
      section. These will either be explained below or with a plugin specific
      section. For example the source code management related global configurations
      for the different SCM systems is available in the SCM chapter.

        <term>Home Directory</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This is not a runtime configurable parameter. It is set by the server on startup. By default it will be
            the value of the HUDSON_HOME environment variable or the <varname>.hudson</varname>
            folder in the home directory of the operating system user running Hudson. The value is displayed here to
            allow the administrator to verify the correct setting.

      <varlistentry>
        <term>System Message</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This is a global system message that is displayed by Hudson in the main screen above the list of
            projects. It can be used as a welcome message or to e.g. broadcast upcoming maintenance to users of the
            Hudson instance via the user interface. It support plain text as well a HTML snippets for formatting and
            enriching the message.

            concurrent Hudson builds.

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Quiet period</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A quiet period as specified in this configuration causes Hudson to wait the specified number of seconds
            before a triggered build is started. If your Hudson project is constantly "flapping" (switching between
            failure and success frequently), you may want to set the Quiet period to achieve more build stability.
            Another scenario this can be helpful is when large commits to your source control system are typically
            carried out in multiple smaller commits within a short time frame, so that the committer has a chance to get
            everything in without a build kicking off straight after the first commit causing a build failure. Setting
            this number to a large amount can generally reduce the number of builds running for this project, which will
            reduce the overall load for your Hudson server.

      <varlistentry>
        <term>SCM checkout retry count</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The SCM checkout retry count determines the number of attempts Hudson makes to check out any updates
            when polling the SCM system for changes and finds the system to be unavailable.
          </para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Enable Security</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The "Enable Security" checkbox switches on the security system that will require username and password
            for any access to run builds or change configurations of Hudson and build projects. More information about
            securing Hudson can be found in <!-- TODO add xref -->

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This feature will enable improved security against Cross Site Request Forgery exploits and is
            recommended to be turned on when your Hudson instance is available to the public internet. On the other
            hand it can be necessary to have this feature disabled, when your Hudson web interface is embedded in a
            dashboard type interface that also contains web content from other domains or even only internal server
            names or sub networks. In general it will not be necessary to enable this feature on an internal network, where
            only trusted parties have access to Hudson.

    <title>Global Properties Configuration</title>
    <para>The global properties configuration allows the definition of key-value pairs that are exposed to all
      running builds as environment variables. Depending on the build system used they can be picked up with
      different syntax e.g. $key or ${key}</para> <!-- TODO this has to be expanded in terms of usage as well as
      some concrete examples, -->
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring JDK Installations</title>

    <para>Hudson can support one or more JDK installations. Setting up multiple JDK installs allows the
      configuration of different projects being built by different Java versions in separate jobs. You can use this
      to ensure e.g. that builds as well as test suites run fine on older Java version to ensure compatibility. Another
      application would be to run with JDK versions supplied by different vendors.</para>
    <para>The most common configuration of a JDK is to point to the already installed instance as used for running
      Hudson itself. This can be achieved simply by supplying a name like Oracle-JDK-6 in the name input field and the
      absolute path in the JAVA_HOME input field in the screen as shown in <xref linkend="fig-using-jdk-config" />.
    </para>

    <para>Furthermore it is possible to configure a JDK to be installed automatically by specifying a name as before and
      then selecting the "Install Automatically" check box. This will expose a drop down which will let you choose a
      specific version of JDK to download and install from
      Oracle. <!-- currently still says java.sun.com but changed and pull request on github done --> Once you configure
      Hudson to download and install the JDK automatically, Hudson will wait for the first build which is configured to
      use a named instance of the JDK to initiate the JDK download and installation.
    </para>
    <para>When more than one JDK is configured in the global settings here, each project configuration will have a drop
      down added via which a JDK can be selected.

     <para>Hudson is designed with a special level of support for Maven
     builds. To use Maven, you must figure configure a Hudson Maven
     installation. To do this, go to the Maven section of the server
     configuration. You can configure one or more installations of Maven, to
     do so, click on the Add Maven button as shown in <xref
     linkend="fig-using-maven-config" />. Then assign your new created Maven
     installation a name which will be displayed in project configuration
     select lists.</para>

     <para>To install a version of Maven automatically from the Apache
     Software Foundation, select "Install Automatically" and then click on
     "Add Installer". Clicking on Add Installer will bring up a list of Maven
     versions available to install. We recommend that you run your build
     using the latest Maven 3.0 release. At this point, Maven will not be
     automatically downloaded and installed. Instead, Hudson will initiate a
     Maven installation the first time a build is run which requires
     Maven.

    <title>Configuring the Shell Executable</title>

    <para>Hudson allows for the ability to configure Shell builds. If you

    script, you can configure which interpreter is used to execute shell
    scripts in this configuration variable.</para>

      <title>Configuring E-mail Notification</title>
      <!-- TODO there should be more and better docu here for this critical

      <para>Email notification is a core feature of a continuous integration
      server, and you can configure the way in which Hudson will connect to an
      SMTP server in the Email Notification section of the server
      configuration screen. In this form you can configure an SMTP server, a
      default user e-mail suffix which is appended to build usernames. You can
      set the administrative email address, and the URL to be used in emails
      which link back to the Hudson UI.</para>

      <para>In addition to basic SMTP configuration parameters, it is also
      possible to configure Hudson to use SMTP auth to send email through
      local services which require secure credentials for sending email or
      public services such as Gmail. To configure these parameters, populate
      the User Name, Password, SSL, SMTP Port parameters. Once you have
      completed the SMTP configuration, click on "Test configuration" to send
      a test email to the administrator email address.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring SCM Polling Concurrency</title>

    <para>This is a simple, global parameter to Hudson which controls the number
      of concurrent threads to be used when polling an SCM system. Most CI
      systems discover code changes in an SCM by continuously polling source
      control. If you have enough project configured, this polling can grow to
      become a significant factor in SCM performance. If you are suffering
      performance issues because you have configured hundreds of projects to
      poll SCM, you can use this one property to define concurrency limits on
      Hudson's ability to concurrently poll an SCM.
